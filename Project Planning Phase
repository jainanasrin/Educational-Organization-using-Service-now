In the project planning phase, the objective is to define the scope, timeline, resources, and responsibilities required to implement ServiceNow within the educational organization. This phase ensures that all activities are organized, scheduled, and aligned with institutional goals.

The planning process begins with identifying key services to be digitized, such as Student Helpdesk, IT Support, Certificate Requests, Faculty Service Desk, and Asset Tracking. Roles and responsibilities are assigned to project team members, including administrators, developers, support staff, and faculty representatives. A project timeline is created that outlines major milestones—requirements gathering, system configuration, testing, training, and final deployment.

Risk assessment is also conducted to identify challenges such as user resistance, data migration complexity, or technical constraints. Mitigation strategies are prepared to ensure smooth execution. Budget planning includes estimating costs for licensing, system customization, training, and maintenance.

Communication channels and reporting guidelines are established to keep all stakeholders updated throughout the project. The outcome of this phase is a well-structured project plan that provides clarity, direction, and readiness for the upcoming design and implementation stages.
