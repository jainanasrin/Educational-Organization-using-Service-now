This project explores how an educational institution can use ServiceNow to streamline academic and administrative processes. In the ideation phase, the focus is on identifying challenges such as slow manual workflows, difficulty in tracking student queries, IT support delays, and limited transparency in approvals. ServiceNow can act as a centralized digital platform where students, faculty, and administrative staff interact efficiently.

The idea is to design modules like Student Helpdesk, Attendance/Leave Requests, Fee & Certificate Request Systems, IT Support Desk, and Asset Tracking. ServiceNow workflows can automate ticket routing, send real-time status updates, and provide dashboards for monitoring performance. Students can raise queries or requests through a self-service portal, while staff can manage tasks in a structured workflow. This reduces confusion, repetitive tasks, and waiting time.

The ideation stage also includes analyzing stakeholder needs, defining key performance indicators, drafting process flow diagrams, and selecting which services to digitize first. The goal is to improve accessibility, transparency, and productivity across departments while ensuring user-friendly interaction.

This phase lays the foundation for designing a modern, efficient, and scalable service management environment within the educational organization.
